Create a function that will output the device type and browser name as an object given the input is the userAgent – function getBrowserDetails(userAgent){}
To test the function use an array of known userAgents(below), loop through those and output the value for each
All development should be done in VSCode and tested in the debugging tab
Please use: https://regexr.com to test, exercise  and debug your regex
Use this array of userAgents for your tests:

{
deviceType : “desktop/tablet/mobile/bot”,
browserName : “Chrome/FF/Safari /bot etc”
}

The task is of moderate difficulty but will give you more than enough to be comfortable with the day-to-day activities. The use of positive/negative lookahead here is a must. Being able to identify capturing groups is a must as well. Feel free to browse for solutions but since you can use regexr.com you should be able to complete it without looking into someone else’s  code.
